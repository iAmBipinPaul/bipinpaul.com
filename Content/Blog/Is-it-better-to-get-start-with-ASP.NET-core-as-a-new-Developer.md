# What is the difference between ASP.NET and other Web Development Platform?

ASP.NET is a Web Development framework from Microsoft which support wide range of Programming language means that you can write your business logics any one of the .NET language (C#, Visual Basic and F# but Currently it only supports c# other language support is coming).

Where as other Web Development platform is confined to a single programming language , like PHP, Ruby on Rails.

# What are the benefits of getting start with ASP.NET core ?

At this point you already knew that ASP.NET can be programmed in any of the .NET language .It supports C# and It is 1st priority of the ASP.NET creator to support C#. When you are choosing C# for the ASP.NET means you are also opening door for System Apps/Software Development, Yes you can develop Apps for IOS,MAC,ANDROID and off course for the windows Platforms.
